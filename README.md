# UCD – Milestone 1 - Zesty Fitness (Kasia's Health & Fitness Website)

This is a front-end web page for a health and fitness trainer called Kasia Holzer.  Kasia is setting up her own business providing a range of personal training, a cooked meal plan service & teaching yoga (this is currently only for children).  She has only recently started doing the meal plans so this is mostly in the development phase. 


She wanted a website that showcases what she offers to her clients and potential clients, how she can help her clients benefit from having a personal trainer, the types of food services she offers as well as recipes for them to try at home and the teaching of yoga to children and how  yoga benefits a child, how it greatly improves more than just flexibility & having fun.  


This webpage was created as the first milestone project as part of the Code Institute ‘Full Stack Development’ course.  

This is for educational purposes only.

## UX

This website is for Kasia’s current & potential clients to see what services she provides and offers. The services currently provided are personal training; either one to one or in a small group, yoga for children and also, various recipes as well as pre-cooked healthy meals. 

It will hopefully bring more clients who will be using more of her services, possibly the entire family working with Kasia to benefit them.  Personal training for the parents, yoga for children and meals & recipes for the entire family. 

There are separate pages targeting each service she provides as well as a contact page to get in contact with any queries or request for additional information.  

### User Stories:

1.	A potential client looking for a local personal trainer can see what services are offered & the cost.
2.	A parent can check the schedule for the ‘Yoga for Kids’ and the price.  
3.	A current client can see the other services that are available eg. Nutritional food plans or group sessions vs one to one sessions
4.	A client or potential client can find recipes for healthy dishes
5.  Clients can follow recipes, workouts or photos on various social media site: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest & videos on Youtube
6.	Parents & children can watch & follow along with either of the two ‘yoga for kids’ videos

The Wireframes for the original layout have been included in the folder assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf
Initially there was going to be a separate page for all the pricing & schedule but as Kasia is still tweaking the prices for the meal plans, the pricing & schedule for both the personal training & yoga for Kids has been included on the respective pages.  For additional information on the prices for the meal services, one would need to either contact Kasia via the contact form or by email/telephone.  
There original design was to include a video with the personal training page but Kasia did not have a good quality video so I was unable to include this.

## Testing
### Responsive Mobile First Design
I tested my website locally using Chrome DevTools.  This tested the resposiveness of the mobile first approach where various pictures changed size as the browzer size changed size as well as the grid layout where applicable.   Once I had deployed my site to Github, I tested this using the Google Chrome add on 'Responsive Web Design Tester'.  Whilst testing here, I noticed that the embedded videos (Yoga for kids page) & the Nutritional photo 'Kasia3.jpg' were not properly sized in the screen. 
Once corrected, the responsiveness acted as expected for all the content. 

#### Different Screen sizes
##### Home 
   1.  Tested that the photos scaled up or down correctly.
   2.  Tested breakpoints of grid items and that these are properly shown in all screensizes
   		*  Profile Picture & About me
   		*  Benefits of Personal Training & Benefits of Yoga
   		*  The Four Testimonials

##### Personal Training
   1.  Tested photos scaled up or down correctly
   2.  Tested breakpoints of grid items and that these are properly shown in all screensizes.  
   		*  Profile Picture 2 & 'Personal Training with Kasia'
   		*  Benefits of Personal Training & Benefits of Yoga
   		*  Pricing details one to one & Pricing details with Friends

##### Yoga for Kids
   1.  Tested photos scaled up or down correctly
   2.  Tested the videos that are in a grid where correctly shown for all screen sizes.  Where at applicable breakpoint, the videos were not side by side but above one another.  
   3.  Tested the 'Kids Yoga!' photo floated left and writing presented correctly at all screensizes.    

#####  Nutrition
   1.  Tested that the profile picture 3 scaled when below the breakpoint, and once it was above that breakpoint it stayed fixed as per the media query.  
   2.  Test breakpoints of grid items and that these are correctly shown in all screensizes.
        *  Profile Picture 3 & Nutrional page info
        *  Dinner photo & Sample Menu Items
        *  The Six sample Menu Item Photos 
        *  Recipe photo & recipe ingredients/Instructions
   3.  Tested that the boxes scaled correctly for Recipe Boxes

#####  Contact
   1.  Tested that the contact form box scaled down correctly in all size displays

###  Browsers
I tested the website on the following browsers:  Safari, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox.  
For each browser I tested the following:
1.  All the Navigational links worked, as well as the Navigational collapsed into the 'Hamburger' in various relevant screen sizes. 
2.  The contact link on each page; Index, Personal Training, Yoga for Kids & Nutrion, that this link takes you to the Contact Page.
3.  On the Yoga for Kids page, I tested the embedded videos and that they played correctly. 
4.  All the social Media links are working and opening up in a new tab.  (These are currently not linked to an external social media site so they currently open up the same page of the Zesty Fitness website in a new tab rather than the applicable social media site.)
5.  The Form completion and submission.  
	* There are two required fields on the form.  Name & Email. 
		1.  Tested that the Name field was filled in but left email blank.  An error message displays that stipulates that the Email field needs to be filled in. "Please fill in this field". 
		2.  Tested the email field is correctly filled in but the name field is left blank.  An error message displays that stipulates that the Name field needs to be filled in. "Please fill in this field".
		3.  Tested if the format of the email address is incorrectly inputted, eg. kasiaholzer.  An error message is displayed stipulating that an '@' is required in the email address.   "Please include an '@' in the email address. kasiaholzer is missing an '@'"
		4.  Tested that it is possible to click three, two, one or none in the 'Of interest' Checkboxes.  
		5.  Tested that it is possible to leave the text area box blank and also to write a query in this text field.
		6.  Tested the submit button.  If the required fields are entered, this submits the form.
