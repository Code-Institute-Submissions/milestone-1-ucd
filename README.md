# UCD – Milestone 1 - Zesty Fitness (Kasia's Health & Fitness Website)

This is a front-end web page for a health and fitness trainer called Kasia.  Kasia is setting up her own business providing a range of personal training, a cooked meal plan service & teaching yoga (this is currently only to children).  She has only recently started doing the meal plans so this is mostly in the development phase. 
She wanted a website that showcases what she offers to her clients and potential clients, how she can help her clients benefit from having a personal trainer, the types of food services she offers as well as recipes for them to try at home and the teaching of yoga to children and how  yoga benefits a child, how it greatly improves more than just flexibility & having fun.  
This webpage was created as the first milestone project as part of the Code Institute ‘Full Stack Development’ course.  This is for educational purposes only.

## UX

This website is for Kasia’s current & potential clients to see what services she provides and offers. The services currently provided are personal training; either one to one or in a small group, yoga for children and also, various recipes as well as pre-cooked healthy meals. 
It will hopefully bring more clients who will be using more of her services, possibly the entire family working with Kasia to benefit them.  Personal training for the parents, yoga for children and meals & recipes for the entire family. 
There are separate pages targeting each service she provides as well as a contact page to get in contact with any queries or request for additional information.  

### User Stories:

1.	A potential client looking for a local personal trainer can see what services are offered & the cost.
2.	A parent can check the schedule for the ‘Yoga for Kids’ and the price.  
3.	A current client can see the other services are available eg. Nutritional food plans or group sessions vs one to one sessions
4.	A client or potential client can find recipes for healthy dishes
5.  Clients can follow recipes, workouts or photos on various social media site: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest & videos on Youtube
6.	Parents & children can watch & follow along with either of the two ‘yoga for kids’ videos

The Wireframes for the original layout have been included in the folder assets/wireframes/wireframes.pdf
Initially there was going to be a separate page for all the pricing & schedule but as Kasia is still tweaking the prices for the meal plans, the pricing & schedule for both the personal training & yoga for Kids has been included on the respective pages.  For additional information on the prices for the meal services, one would need to either contact Kasia via the contact form or by email/telephone.
